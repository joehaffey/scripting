# scripting
These are my exploits with the various scripting languages used in web development.  Right now, I'm learning Python but I plan to add PHP, Ruby, and the scripting languages used with the various open source packages as well as shell script.  I know it's a lot to learn but I'm doing this to make myself more flexible as a freelancer.
