this program demonstrates a for loop in python.  it uses the range function which allows the user to specify the number of iterations of the loop.  
'''

#times to repeat
times = int(input('enter the number of iterations: '))

#feeds the number of iterations into the loop
repeat = range(times)

#the loop
for again in repeat:
	print('up yours mother fucker')
